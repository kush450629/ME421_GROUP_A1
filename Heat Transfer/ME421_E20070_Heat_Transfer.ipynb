        "A factory involved in the manufacturing of dairy products is required to store milk received from collecting centers in a cool room until delivery to the factory the following day. Aluminum containers are received at approximately 1400 hrs. The average temperature of the collected milk ranges from 35°C to 40°C. The system is required to cool the bulk to 15°C within two hours and maintain that temperature until the delivery time at 1400 hrs the next day.\n",
